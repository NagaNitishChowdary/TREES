ROOT ---- THE STARTING OF THE TREE IS KNOWN AS ROOT 
LEAF ---- THE NODE WHICH HAS NO CHILDREN
BINARY TREE ---- NAME ITSELF DESCRIBING IT CAN HAS ATMOST TWO CHILDREN
TYPES ---- 5 TYPES OF BINARY TREES
           1) FULL BINARY TREE ---- EITHER HAS 0 OR 2 CHILDREN
           2) COMPLETE BINARY TREE ---- ALL LEVELS ARE COMPLETELY FILLED EXCEPT LAST LEVEL
                                   ---- THE LAST LEVEL HAS ALL NODES ON LEFT AS POSSIBLE
           3) PERFECT BINARY TREE ---- ALL LEAF NODES ARE AT SAME LEVEL
           4) BALANCED BINARY TREE ---- HEIGHT CAN BE AT MAX OF LOG(N) WHERE N IS NO OF NODES
           5) DEGENERATE TREE ---- EVERY NODE HAS A SINGLE CHILDREN (OR) SKEW TREE (OR) SAME AS STRAIGHT LINE

TREE TRAVERSALS ---- BFS/DFS 
                ---- DFS IS OF 3 TYPES
                ---- 1) INORDER(LEFT ROOT RIGHT)
                ---- 2) PREORDER(ROOT LEFT RIGHT)
                ---- 3) POSTORDER(LEFT RIGHT ROOT)
                ---- BFS TRAVERSAL IS LEVEL WISE TRAVERSAL FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
